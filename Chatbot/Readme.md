#Idea

Task was to make a regular bot which converts only numbers but donot take in consideration the sentence. But, I tried to add some additional functionality to simple bot. I tried to add sentiment to sentence.  
If not is present before a number then most probably the user donot want to convert that number.  
I did some cleaning to get 'not' from the sentence Eg. don't :- do not.  
Also not can also be present before convert and translate.
